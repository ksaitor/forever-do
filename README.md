# TODO App
So here is a TODO app. Hundreds of them around the web :)

Yes, I took it from somewhere on the web and deleted references — but this does not matter now.

Currently it is simple. Just a MVP of something we've been envisioning…
We have many ideas in mind and committed to work on this app for several years. We will build a team of outstanding developers to collaborate and to push the limits of web technology with this TODO app. It will live long and prosper… so will the team :) Hopefully. Depends on you.

Your responsibility is to ensure that the app got it's fundamental architecture in place. Code structure allows multiple people can collaborate on the it with ease, new features can be developed blazingly fast, maintenance is a bliss, various testing strategies can be applied, etc…

A good idea would be to modularize the code and decouple concerns. You have experience with BackboneJS and RequireJS. A good beginning would be to introduce best practices of requirejs to the initial prototype.

### TL;DR

Must-have:
- restructure current code with requirejs

Nice-to-have:
- decouple templates into separate files (handlebars preferred)
- eliminate 3rd party dependencies from local repo - rely on some cdn
- getting modular structure for styles would also benefit significantly

Notes:
- we are not expecting everything to be done
- app must _work_ after restructuring
- feel free to be opinionated
- we don't like comments in code. CodeHaveToSpeakForItself()
- And as Mr. Jeff Atwood said "commit often commit early"

Thanks.
Hope to see you soon!
